=head1 SYNPOSIS

 use Config::ZOMG;

 my $config = Config::ZOMG->new(
   name => 'my_application',
   path => 'path/to/my/application',
 );
 my $config_hash = $config->load;

This will look for something like (depending on what L<Config::Any> will find):

 path/to/my/application/my_application_local.{yml,yaml,cnf,conf,jsn,json,...}

and

 path/to/my/application/my_application.{yml,yaml,cnf,conf,jsn,json,...}

... and load the found configuration information appropiately, with C<_local>
taking precedence.

You can also specify a file directly:

 my $config = Config::ZOMG->new(file => '/path/to/my/application/my_application.cnf');

To later reload your configuration:

 $config->reload;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Config::ZOMG> is a fork of L<Config::JFDI>.  It removes a couple of unusual
features and passes the same tests three times faster than L<Config::JFDI>.

C<Config::ZOMG> is an implementation of L<Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader>
that exists outside of L<Catalyst>.

C<Config::ZOMG> will scan a directory for files matching a certain name. If
such a file is found which also matches an extension that L<Config::Any> can
read, then the configuration from that file will be loaded.

C<Config::ZOMG> will also look for special files that end with a C<_local>
suffix. Files with this special suffix will take precedence over any other
existing configuration file, if any. The precedence takes place by merging
the local configuration with the "standard" configuration via
L<Hash::Merge::Simple>.

Finally you can override/modify the path search from outside your application,
by setting the C<< ${NAME}_CONFIG >> variable outside your application (where
C<$NAME> is the uppercase version of what you passed to
L<< Config::ZOMG->new|/new >>).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

 $config = Config::ZOMG->new(...)

Returns a new C<Config::ZOMG> object

You can configure the C<$config> object by passing the following to new:

=over 2

=item name

The name specifying the prefix of the configuration file to look for and
the ENV variable to read. This can be a package name. In any case, ::
will be substituted with _ in C<name> and the result will be lowercased.
To prevent modification of C<name>, pass it in as a scalar reference.

=item C<path>

The directory to search in

=item C<file>

Directly read the configuration from this file. C<Config::Any> must recognize
the extension. Setting this will override C<path>

=item C<no_local>

Disable lookup of a local configuration. The C<local_suffix> option will be
ignored. Off by default

=item C<local_suffix>

The suffix to match when looking for a local configuration. C<local> by default

=item C<no_env>

Set this to ignore ENV. C<env_lookup> will be ignored. Off by default

=item C<env_lookup>

Additional ENV to check if C<< $ENV{<NAME>...} >> is not found

=item C<driver>

A hash consisting of C<Config::> driver information. This is passed directly
through to C<Config::Any>

=item C<default>

A hash filled with default keys/values

=back

=head2 open

 $config_hash = Config::ZOMG->open( ... )

As an alternative way to load a config C<open> will pass given arguments to
L</new> then attempt to do L</load>

Unlike L</load> if no configuration files are found C<open> will return
C<undef> (or the empty list)

This is so you can do something like:

 my $config_hash = Config::ZOMG->open( '/path/to/application.cnf' )
   or die "Couldn't find config file!"

In scalar context C<open> will return the config hash, B<not> the config
object. If you want the config object call C<open> in list context:

    my ($config_hash, $config) = Config::ZOMG->open( ... )

You can pass any arguments to C<open> that you would to L</new>

=head2 load

 $config->load

Load a config as specified by L</new> and C<ENV> and return a hash

This will only load the configuration once, so it's safe to call multiple
times without incurring any loading-time penalty

=head2 found

 $config->found

Returns a list of files found

If the list is empty then no files were loaded/read

=head2 find

  $config->find

Returns a list of files that configuration will be loaded from. Use this method
to check whether configuration files have changed, without actually reloading.

=head2 clone

 $config->clone

Return a clone of the configuration hash using L<Clone>

This will load the configuration first, if it hasn't already

=head2 reload

 $config->reload

Reload the configuration, examining ENV and scanning the path anew

Returns a hash of the configuration
